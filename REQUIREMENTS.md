# Kula World Clone - Software Requirements Specification

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Baseline

## Introduction

This document outlines the software requirements for the **Kula World Clone**, a browser-based 3D puzzle-platformer inspired by the PlayStation classic. It serves as the single source of truth for what the system must do, the constraints under which it must operate, and the rules governing its development and deployment.

Each requirement has a **unique, stable ID** (e.g., `PROD-001`). These IDs **MUST** be used to link implementation stories and test cases back to these foundational requirements, ensuring complete traceability.

The requirement keywords (`MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `SHOULD`, `SHOULD NOT`, `MAY`) are used as defined in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## 1. Product & Functional Requirements

*Defines what the system does; its core features and capabilities.*

| ID | Title | Description | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <a name="PROD-001"></a>**PROD-001** | **Core Mechanic:** Gravity Reorientation | When the player avatar crosses from one surface to an adjacent, perpendicular surface, the system **MUST** reorient the world's gravity vector to align with the new surface's normal. The player is then "pulled" onto this new surface. | This is the unique selling point and central puzzle mechanic of the game, creating challenges based on non-linear spatial awareness. |
| <a name="PROD-002"></a>**PROD-002** | **Player Movement:** Rolling | The player avatar **MUST** be able to roll across surfaces, controlled by directional input. Movement **MUST** have a sense of momentum, with gradual acceleration and deceleration. | This is the primary mode of locomotion for the player and the feeling of weight is critical to the game's feel and control precision. |
| <a name="PROD-003"></a>**PROD-003** | **Player Movement:** Jumping | The player avatar **MUST** be able to perform a jump of a fixed, limited height. | Jumping is a core mechanic for crossing small gaps, avoiding hazards, and adds a layer of precision to movement challenges. |
| <a name="PROD-004"></a>**PROD-004** | **Level Objective:** Key Collection | Levels **MUST** contain one or more keys. The player **MUST** collect all required keys to enable the level's exit. | This provides a clear, primary objective for the player to complete in each level, guiding their exploration. |
| <a name="PROD-005"></a>**PROD-005** | **Level Objective:** Exit Portal | Each level **MUST** have an exit portal. The portal **MUST** be in a locked state until all required keys are collected, at which point it **MUST** transition to an unlocked state. Entering the unlocked portal completes the level. | This serves as the final goal and clear completion condition for each puzzle. |
| <a name="PROD-006"></a>**PROD-006** | **Failure Condition:** Falling | If the player avatar moves over an edge with no adjacent surface to adhere to, it **MUST** enter a "fall" state, resulting in the loss of one life. | This is the primary penalty and hazard, defining the boundaries of the playable space and creating risk. |
| <a name="PROD-007"></a>**PROD-007** | **Failure Condition:** Hazards | Levels **MAY** contain hazards (e.g., spikes). Collision with a hazard **MUST** result in the loss of one life. | Hazards introduce varied challenges and require players to master timing and precision in their movement. |
| <a name="PROD-008"></a>**PROD-008** | **Progression:** Lives System | The player **MUST** have a finite number of lives. Losing all lives **MUST** result in a "Game Over" state. Lives **MAY** be replenished by collecting life-up items within levels. | The lives system creates stakes for failure and a mechanism for managing overall game progression and difficulty. |
| <a name="PROD-009"></a>**PROD-009** | **Camera System:** Automated Tracking | The camera **MUST** automatically follow the player avatar. It **MUST** rotate smoothly to align with the current gravity orientation when a gravity shift occurs. | To ensure the player remains the focal point and to mitigate disorientation during the core gravity reorientation mechanic. |
| <a name="PROD-010"></a>**PROD-010** | **Collectibles:** Scoring | Levels **SHOULD** contain secondary collectibles (e.g., coins, gems). Collecting these items **MUST** increase the player's score. | To provide optional objectives, encourage exploration, and introduce risk/reward scenarios for skilled players. |
| <a name="PROD-011"></a>**PROD-011** | **Level Structure:** Modular Blocks | All levels **MUST** be constructed from a set of modular, grid-aligned platform blocks (e.g., standard, moving, disappearing). | This allows for efficient level design, consistent physics, and a recognizable art style. |
| <a name="PROD-012"></a>**PROD-012** | **Audio:** Sound Effects | The system **MUST** provide immediate auditory feedback for key game events, including but not limited to: jumping, collecting an item, falling, and colliding with a hazard. | Sound effects are critical for player feedback, reinforcing actions and enhancing the user's sense of immersion and control. |

## 2. User Interaction Requirements

*Defines how a user interacts with the system. Focuses on usability and user-facing workflows.*

| ID | Title | Description | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <a name="USER-001"></a>**USER-001** | **Input:** Player Control | The system **MUST** map user input (keyboard and/or gamepad) to player actions. This **MUST** include directional controls for rolling and a dedicated button for jumping. | To provide direct and intuitive control over the player avatar, which is fundamental to the game's playability. |
| <a name="USER-002"></a>**USER-002** | **UI:** Heads-Up Display (HUD) | The game view **MUST** include a persistent HUD that displays critical game state information: the number of keys collected versus the total required, the current score, and the number of lives remaining. | To provide the player with essential, at-a-glance information needed to make informed decisions during gameplay. |
| <a name="USER-003"></a>**USER-003** | **UI:** Level Completion Screen | Upon successful completion of a level, the system **MUST** display a summary screen showing the score and any other relevant statistics for that level. | To provide a clear sense of accomplishment and a moment of pause before the player proceeds to the next level. |

## 3. Architectural Requirements

*Defines high-level, non-negotiable design principles and structural constraints.*

| ID | Title | Description | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <a name="ARCH-001"></a>**ARCH-001** | Modular Game Systems | The game engine **MUST** be designed with distinct, decoupled modules for core concerns. At a minimum, this **MUST** include: `PlayerController`, `PhysicsManager`, `CameraController`, `LevelManager`, and `UIManager`. | To promote separation of concerns, improving testability, maintainability, and allowing for parallel development of different game systems. |
| <a name="ARCH-002"></a>**ARCH-002** | Data-Driven Levels | Level layouts, including the placement of platforms, keys, hazards, and collectibles, **MUST** be defined in an external data format (e.g., JSON, XML) that is loaded by the `LevelManager` at runtime. | To decouple level design from game logic, allowing designers to create, iterate on, and test levels without requiring changes to the core application code. |

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

*Defines the quality attributes and operational characteristics of the system. The "-ilities".*

| ID | Title | Description | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <a name="NFR-001"></a>**NFR-001** | **Performance:** Frame Rate | The application **MUST** maintain a stable and smooth frame rate (target: 60 FPS) on modern web browsers and typical hardware to ensure responsive controls and a fluid visual experience. | A consistent frame rate is critical for a platforming game that requires precise timing. Dropped frames can lead to missed inputs and a frustrating player experience. |
| <a name="NFR-002"></a>**NFR-002** | **Usability:** Control Precision | Player controls **MUST** be tuned to feel responsive and precise, avoiding a "floaty" or sluggish feel. The relationship between player input and avatar movement must be predictable. | The game's challenge is intended to come from its puzzles, not from fighting with imprecise controls. High-quality game feel is essential for player retention. |
| <a name="NFR-003"></a>**NFR-003** | **Aesthetics:** Visual Identity | The game's visual style **MUST** be minimalist and geometric, featuring high-contrast elements. The player avatar **MUST** be brightly colored to be easily distinguishable from the environment. | This creates a clean, readable, and timeless aesthetic that focuses the player's attention on the puzzle layout and gameplay mechanics. |
