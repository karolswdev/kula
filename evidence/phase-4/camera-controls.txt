Camera Controls Implementation
==============================

CRITICAL FEATURE ADDITION - Phase 4
------------------------------------

Problem Identified:
- level-test.html claimed camera controls existed but were NOT implemented
- Missing mouse drag rotation
- Missing Q/E keyboard rotation  
- No zoom functionality

Solution Implemented:
--------------------

1. Created CameraControls Module (/src/camera/CameraControls.js)
   - Mouse drag rotation around player
   - Q/E keys for left/right rotation
   - Mouse wheel zoom (5-30 unit range)
   - Smooth damping for all movements
   - Respects gravity orientation changes

2. Integration with CameraController
   - Manual controls toggle
   - Seamless switch between auto/manual
   - Maintains up vector during gravity shifts
   - Spherical coordinate system

3. User Controls:
   - Left Mouse Drag: Rotate camera around player
   - Q Key: Rotate camera left
   - E Key: Rotate camera right
   - Mouse Wheel: Zoom in/out
   - All controls respect current gravity

Technical Details:
-----------------
- Spherical coordinates (radius, theta, phi)
- SLERP for smooth up vector transitions
- Damping factor: 0.1 for smooth motion
- Rotation speed: 0.5 (mouse), 2.0 rad/s (keyboard)
- Zoom speed: 1.2x multiplier

Testing:
--------
✓ Mouse drag rotates in all directions
✓ Q/E keys rotate horizontally
✓ Zoom maintains min/max limits
✓ Controls work after gravity shifts
✓ Cursor changes to grab/grabbing

Result: FULLY FUNCTIONAL ✓

This was a critical missing feature that users expected based on the UI claims.
Now properly implemented and integrated with the existing camera system.
