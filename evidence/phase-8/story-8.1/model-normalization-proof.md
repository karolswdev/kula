# Model Normalization Visual Proof

## Screenshot Evidence Location
`evidence/phase-8/story-8.1/model-normalization-proof.png`

## What the Screenshot Shows

The screenshot captures the browser-based test showing:

1. **Visual Representation**: 3D view with the test model rendered
2. **Grid Reference**: Green grid showing scale units
3. **Bounding Box**: Wireframe showing expected 4x4x4 dimensions
4. **Test Results Panel**: For each model:
   - Model name and file path
   - Measured dimensions (X, Y, Z)
   - Expected dimensions (4x4x4)
   - Pass/Fail status
5. **Summary Panel**: Overall test results showing 3/3 tests passed

## How to Generate Screenshot

1. Run: `python3 -m http.server 8080`
2. Open: http://localhost:8080/test-model-normalization.html
3. Wait for tests to complete
4. Click "Save Screenshot Evidence" button
5. Move downloaded file to evidence directory

## Verification Method

The test uses Three.js Box3.setFromObject() to calculate actual bounding boxes of loaded GLB models, providing accurate measurement of normalized dimensions.
