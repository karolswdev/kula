# STORY-5.1: Environmental Hazards & Platforms - Test Evidence

## Test Case TC-5.1: Hazard Collision Triggers Life Loss
**Requirement:** PROD-007 - Failure Condition: Hazards

### Implementation
- Created `Hazard.js` entity class with visual and physics representation
- Supports multiple hazard types: spikes, lava
- Pulsing glow animation for clear danger indication
- Integrated collision detection in Game.js update loop

### Test Method
```javascript
PlayerController_OnCollisionWithHazard_TriggersLifeLost() {
    // Arrange: Level with spike hazard
    // Act: Roll player over spikes
    // Assert: Life lost event triggered, lives decremented
}
```

### Evidence
- **Console Log Output:**
```
Initial lives: 3
Found 3 hazards in level
spikes-1: spikes at (13, 0.5, 0)
spikes-2: spikes at (-4, 0.5, -8)
lava-pit: lava at (5, -0.5, -8)
Game::handleHazardCollision - Player hit hazard: {damage: true, type: "spikes"}
Lives after hazard collision: 2
✅ TC-5.1 PASSED: Hazard collision detected, life lost
```

### Visual Confirmation
- Red spikes rendered with metallic material and emissive glow
- Player mesh flashes red on collision
- Lives counter decrements in HUD

## Test Case TC-5.2: Moving Platform Creation and Movement
**Requirement:** PROD-011 - Level Structure: Modular Blocks

### Implementation
- Created `MovingPlatform.js` entity class
- Supports linear, circular, and sine wave movement patterns
- Waypoint-based movement with pause at endpoints
- Visual path indicators showing platform trajectory

### Test Method
```javascript
LevelManager_LoadLevel_CreatesMovingPlatform() {
    // Arrange: Level data with moving platform specification
    // Act: Load level
    // Assert: Platform created, moves along path, player can ride
}
```

### Evidence
- **Console Log Output:**
```
Found 2 moving platforms
Platform "moving-platform-1" with 4 waypoints at speed 2
Initial position: (5.00, 2.00, 8.00)
Platform position after 2s: (7.85, 2.00, 8.00)
Platform moved 2.85 units
✅ TC-5.2 PASSED: Platform moved correctly
```

### Platform Configuration (from level-1.json)
```json
{
  "id": "moving-platform-1",
  "position": { "x": 5, "y": 2, "z": 8 },
  "size": { "width": 3, "height": 0.5, "depth": 3 },
  "movement": {
    "type": "linear",
    "waypoints": [[5, 2, 8], [9, 2, 8], [9, 2, 12], [5, 2, 12]],
    "speed": 2,
    "pauseTime": 1
  }
}
```

### Visual Confirmation
- Blue moving platforms with slight transparency
- Smooth movement between waypoints
- Path visualization showing platform trajectory
- Player successfully rides platform when standing on it

---

## Summary
Both test cases for STORY-5.1 have passed successfully:
- ✅ TC-5.1: Hazard collision system fully functional
- ✅ TC-5.2: Moving platforms implemented and working

The implementation fulfills requirements PROD-007 and PROD-011.
