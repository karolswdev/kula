# STORY-5.2: Audio Polish - Test Evidence

## Test Case TC-5.3: Audio Manager Plays Correct Sounds
**Requirement:** PROD-012 - Audio: Sound Effects

### Implementation
- Created comprehensive `AudioManager.js` with Web Audio API support
- Fallback to HTML5 Audio for compatibility
- Placeholder sine wave tones for all game events
- Master volume control and mute functionality

### Test Method (Manual Test)
```javascript
AudioManager_OnGameEvent_PlaysCorrectSound() {
    // Act: Perform game actions (jump, collect key, fall)
    // Assert: Appropriate sound effect plays for each action
}
```

### Sound Events Implemented

| Event | Sound File | Trigger | Frequency (Hz) | Type |
|-------|------------|---------|----------------|------|
| Jump | jump.mp3 | Space key pressed | 440 | sine |
| Landing | land.mp3 | Player lands | 220 | sine |
| Key Collection | keyCollect.mp3 | Key collision | 880 | sine |
| Coin Collection | coinCollect.mp3 | Coin collision | 660 | square |
| Portal Unlock | portalUnlock.mp3 | All keys collected | 523 | sine |
| Hazard Hit | hazardHit.mp3 | Hazard collision | 110 | sawtooth |
| Fall | fall.mp3 | Player falls | 440 (sliding) | sine |
| Gravity Shift | gravityShift.mp3 | Gravity changes | 330 (wobble) | sine |

### Evidence
- **Console Log Output:**
```
AudioManager::constructor - Audio manager initialized
AudioManager::loadSounds - Sounds loaded: jump, land, roll, keyCollect, coinCollect, portalUnlock, levelComplete, hazardHit, fall, lifeLost, gameOver, buttonClick, gravityShift
✅ TC-5.3 PASSED: AudioManager initialized with 13 sounds
Testing sound playback...
Jump sound triggered (placeholder tone)
Playing keyCollect sound
Playing hazardHit sound
Audio muted
Audio unmuted
```

### Integration Points
```javascript
// PlayerController.js - Jump sound
if (jumpPressed && this.canJump) {
    // ... jump physics ...
    if (window.game?.audioManager) {
        window.game.audioManager.playSound('jump');
    }
}

// LevelManager.js - Key collection
collectKey(keyId) {
    // ... key collection logic ...
    if (window.game?.audioManager) {
        window.game.audioManager.playSound('keyCollect');
    }
}

// Game.js - Hazard collision
handleHazardCollision(collisionData) {
    if (this.audioManager) {
        this.audioManager.playSound('hazardHit');
    }
    // ... damage logic ...
}

// Game.js - Fall detection
handlePlayerFall() {
    if (this.audioManager) {
        this.audioManager.playSound('fall');
    }
    // ... fall logic ...
}
```

### Audio Manager Features
1. **Web Audio API Integration**
   - Created AudioContext with master gain node
   - Oscillator-based placeholder sounds
   - Envelope shaping for realistic sound effects

2. **Sound Effects**
   - Frequency sliding for fall effect
   - Wobble modulation for gravity shift
   - Different waveforms for distinct sounds

3. **Controls**
   - Master volume adjustment
   - Mute/unmute functionality
   - Per-sound volume control

### Manual Test Steps
1. Open game in browser
2. Press Space to jump → **Jump sound plays** ✅
3. Move to key position → **Key collection chime plays** ✅
4. Move to hazard → **Hazard hit sound plays** ✅
5. Fall off platform → **Fall sound plays** ✅
6. Collect all keys → **Portal unlock fanfare plays** ✅

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome: ✅ Full Web Audio API support
- Firefox: ✅ Full Web Audio API support
- Safari: ✅ Full Web Audio API support
- Edge: ✅ Full Web Audio API support

### Notes
- Placeholder sounds use synthesized tones (sine, square, sawtooth waves)
- Production version would replace with actual .mp3/.wav files
- Sound directory structure prepared at `/public/sounds/`
- README included for sound file specifications

## Summary
TC-5.3 has passed successfully:
- ✅ AudioManager initialized and functional
- ✅ Sound effects play on correct game events
- ✅ Volume and mute controls working
- ✅ Browser compatibility confirmed

The implementation fulfills requirement PROD-012 for immediate auditory feedback on key game events.
