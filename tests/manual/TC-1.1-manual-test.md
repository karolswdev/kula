# Test Case TC-1.1: System_Initialize_RenderScene_DisplaysCorrectly

## Test Method Signature
`System_Initialize_RenderScene_DisplaysCorrectly()`

## Test Objective
Verify that the three.js scene initializes and renders correctly with all required elements visible:
- Floor plane
- Player avatar (red sphere)  
- Light source (shadows visible)

## Test Steps

### Setup
1. Open terminal in project root directory
2. Run `npm start` to start the HTTP server
3. Open web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080

### Execution
1. **ARRANGE**: Load the application in the browser
2. **ACT**: Wait for the scene to render (should be immediate)
3. **ASSERT**: Verify the following elements are visible:
   - A gray floor plane in the center of the scene
   - A bright red sphere (player avatar) positioned on the floor
   - Sky blue background
   - Proper lighting with shadows cast by the sphere onto the floor
   - No console errors in the browser developer tools

### Expected Results
- The scene renders without errors
- All three required elements (floor, sphere, light) are clearly visible
- The sphere appears bright red and distinguishable from the gray floor
- Shadows are rendered showing the light source is working
- Console logs show successful initialization messages

### Actual Results
To be filled after test execution.

## Evidence Required
- Screenshot of the rendered scene showing all elements
- Console log output showing initialization messages
