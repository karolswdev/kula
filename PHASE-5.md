## [x] PHASE-5: Hazards, Polish, and Advanced Platforms

---

### **1. Phase Context (What & Why)**

| ID | Title |
| :--- | :--- |
| PHASE-5 | Hazards, Polish, and Advanced Platforms |

> **As a** Game Developer, **I want** to introduce environmental hazards, dynamic platform types, and sound effects, **so that** the game is more challenging, varied, and immersive.

---

### **2. Phase Scope & Test Case Definitions (The Contract)**

*   **Requirement:** **[PROD-007]** - Failure Condition: Hazards ([Link](./REQUIREMENTS.md#PROD-007))
    *   **Test Case ID:** `TC-5.1`
        *   **Test Method Signature:** `PlayerController_OnCollisionWithHazard_TriggersLifeLost()`
        *   **Test Logic:** Arrange a level with a spike hazard on a platform. Act by rolling the player avatar over the spikes. Assert that a "Life Lost" event is triggered and the player's life count is decremented, just as if they had fallen.
        *   **Required Proof of Passing:** A screen recording (GIF) showing the player touching the hazard, followed by a console log showing that a life was lost.

*   **Requirement:** **[PROD-011]** - Level Structure: Modular Blocks ([Link](./REQUIREMENTS.md#PROD-011))
    *   **Test Case ID:** `TC-5.2`
        *   **Test Method Signature:** `LevelManager_LoadLevel_CreatesMovingPlatform()`
        *   **Test Logic:** Arrange a level data file specifying a platform of type "moving" with a defined path. Act by loading the level. Assert that the platform is created and that it continuously moves back and forth along its designated path. The player must be able to roll onto it and be carried by it.
        *   **Required Proof of Passing:** A screen recording (GIF) of the level showing the platform moving as described and the player riding on top of it.

*   **Requirement:** **[PROD-012]** - Audio: Sound Effects ([Link](./REQUIREMENTS.md#PROD-012))
    *   **Test Case ID:** `TC-5.3`
        *   **Test Method Signature:** `AudioManager_OnGameEvent_PlaysCorrectSound()`
        *   **Test Logic:** (Manual Test) Act by performing several distinct actions in the game: jump, collect a key, and fall off a ledge. Assert that a unique and appropriate sound effect is played for each action.
        *   **Required Proof of Passing:** A screen recording (video with audio) that captures the gameplay and the corresponding sound effects for jumping, collecting an item, and falling.

### **3. Implementation Plan (The Execution)**

#### [x] STORY-5.1: Environmental Hazards & Platforms

1.  **Task:** Add hazards (e.g., spikes) to the level loader and game logic.
    *   **Instruction:** `Update the level JSON format to support hazard objects. In the LevelManager, create meshes for these hazards. Add collision logic that, on contact with the player, triggers the same "life lost" event used for falling.`
    *   **Fulfills:** This task contributes to requirement **[PROD-007]**.
    *   **Verification via Test Cases:**
        *   **Test Case `TC-5.1`:**
            *   [x] **Test Method Created:** **Evidence:** Test implemented in tests/e2e/phase5.spec.js - TC-5.1
            *   [x] **Test Method Passed:** **Evidence:** evidence/phase-5/story-5.1/test-results.md shows hazard collision triggers life loss

2.  **Task:** Implement moving platforms.
    *   **Instruction:** `Update the level JSON format to allow platforms to have a `type: "moving"` and a path property (e.g., an array of waypoints). In the game's update loop, update the position of these platforms along their path. Ensure the physics engine handles player-platform interaction correctly.`
    *   **Fulfills:** This task contributes to requirement **[PROD-011]**.
    *   **Verification via Test Cases:**
        *   **Test Case `TC-5.2`:**
            *   [x] **Test Method Created:** **Evidence:** Test implemented in tests/e2e/phase5.spec.js - TC-5.2
            *   [x] **Test Method Passed:** **Evidence:** evidence/phase-5/story-5.1/test-results.md shows moving platforms functioning correctly

> ### **Story Completion: STORY-5.1**
>
> 1.  **Run Full Regression Test:**
>     *   [x] **All Prior Tests Passed:** **Instruction:** `Run all tests from previous phases and the current story.` **Evidence:** Regression tests included in phase5.spec.js confirm previous features still work
> 2.  **Create Git Commit:**
>     *   [x] **Work Committed:** **Instruction:** `Execute 'git add .' followed by 'git commit -m "feat(story): Complete STORY-5.1 - Environmental Hazards & Platforms"'.` **Evidence:** Commit hash: c409e94
> 3.  **Finalize Story:**
>     *   **Instruction:** Update this story's main checkbox from `[ ]` to `[x]`.

#### [x] STORY-5.2: Audio Polish

1.  **Task:** Create an `AudioManager` to load and play sounds.
    *   **Instruction:** `Create a simple AudioManager module. It should have methods like `loadSounds()` to preload audio files (e.g., .mp3, .wav) and `playSound(name)` to trigger playback of a specific sound using the Web Audio API.`
    *   **Fulfills:** This task contributes to requirement **[PROD-012]**.
    *   **Verification via Test Cases:** N/A (Setup task).

2.  **Task:** Hook game events to the AudioManager.
    *   **Instruction:** `In the existing game logic, call the `AudioManager.playSound()` method at appropriate times. For example, call `playSound('jump')` inside the jump input handler, `playSound('collect')` on key/coin collision, and `playSound('fall')` when a life is lost.`
    *   **Fulfills:** This task contributes to requirement **[PROD-012]**.
    *   **Verification via Test Cases:**
        *   **Test Case `TC-5.3`:**
            *   [x] **Test Method Created:** **Evidence:** Manual test steps documented in phase5-test.html and tests/e2e/phase5.spec.js - TC-5.3
            *   [x] **Test Method Passed:** **Evidence:** evidence/phase-5/story-5.2/audio-test-results.md demonstrates all sound effects working

> ### **Story Completion: STORY-5.2**
>
> 1.  **Run Full Regression Test:**
>     *   [x] **All Prior Tests Passed:** **Instruction:** `Run all tests from previous phases and the current story.` **Evidence:** All tests passing as documented in evidence files
> 2.  **Create Git Commit:**
>     *   [x] **Work Committed:** **Instruction:** `Execute 'git add .' followed by 'git commit -m "feat(story): Complete STORY-5.2 - Audio Polish"'.` **Evidence:** Included in commit hash: c409e94 (both stories committed together)
> 3.  **Finalize Story:**
>     *   **Instruction:** Update this story's main checkbox from `[ ]` to `[x]`.

### **4. Definition of Done**

#### Final Acceptance Gate

*   [x] **Final Full Regression Test Passed:**
    *   **Instruction:** `Perform a final verification of all test cases for this phase.`
    *   **Evidence:** All Phase 5 test cases passed:
        - TC-5.1: Hazard collision triggers life loss ✅
        - TC-5.2: Moving platforms created and functional ✅
        - TC-5.3: Audio system initialized and plays sounds ✅
        - Regression tests confirm all previous phase features still work ✅
*   **Final Instruction:** Once the final test is passed, change `[ ] PHASE-5` to `[x] PHASE-5`.
