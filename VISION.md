# VISION.md: Project Kula Web

## 1. Vision Statement

To resurrect the mind-bending, gravity-defying puzzle experience of a beloved 90s classic, delivering it to a new generation of players through the instant accessibility of the modern web. We are building not just a clone, but a faithful tribute that captures the original's unique challenge and charm while being engineered for flawless, browser-based play.

## 2. Core Pillars & Design Philosophy

These are the foundational principles that will guide every development and design decision. They are the non-negotiable "feel" of the final product.

#### üèõÔ∏è **Pillar 1: The Joy of Spatial Discovery**

The core of the game is the "aha!" moment when the player mentally reorients the puzzle and sees the path forward. Our primary goal is to create challenges that test a player's spatial reasoning above all else. Level design will prioritize clever navigation and perspective shifts over punishing reflex-based challenges. The player's greatest tool is their mind, not their twitch skills.

#### üèõÔ∏è **Pillar 2: Purity of Mechanics**

The game's beauty lies in its simplicity: **Roll, Jump, and Stick**. We will resist the temptation to add extraneous features. The depth and complexity will emerge not from adding more mechanics, but from designing increasingly intricate environments that test the player's mastery of these fundamental actions. This ensures a low barrier to entry but a very high skill ceiling.

#### üèõÔ∏è **Pillar 3: Flow and Predictable Momentum**

The player avatar is not just a point in space; it is a physical object with weight and momentum. The controls must feel tight, responsive, and predictable. The camera is the player's silent partner‚Äîit must be fluid, intelligent, and smooth, especially during gravity shifts, to empower the player and minimize disorientation. The simple act of navigating the world should feel satisfying and kinetic.

#### üèõÔ∏è **Pillar 4: Minimalist Aesthetic, Maximum Clarity**

The visual style will be clean, geometric, and high-contrast. This is a deliberate design choice that serves gameplay. By removing visual noise, we ensure the puzzle's layout, hazards, and objectives are always perfectly readable. The player should be focused on *solving* the puzzle, not deciphering a cluttered screen. The aesthetic is a tool for clarity.

## 3. Value Proposition: Why Play This Game?

This section defines what makes our game a worthwhile experience and who it is for.
